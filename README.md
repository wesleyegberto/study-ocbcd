Oracle Certified Business Component Developer Study


Projects to demonstrate and test the capabilities of EJB 2.x/3.x and JPA.


Note:
>
* Before read the code of study.ejb3 package read the study.ejb2 package, because the ejb2 classes are completely commented about the code, lifecycle, services and so on. In ejb3 classes they are only, almost, rewrite with the new way (EJB 3.x) of creating a EJB and using the new capabilities of EJB;
* I used J2EE RI and JBoss AS 7.1.



Projects to study the implementation, lifecycle and capabilities of EJB 2.x and 3.x and JPA. I've tested Stateless Session Bean, Stateful Session Bean, Entity Bean, Message-Driven Bean, Singleton Bean, beans CMT and BMT, JPA, security. Also I tested deployment and its configurations of deploy-time. And was tested the client interface with remote and local EJB.

The project Bank can show us a bit of the difference in development between EJB 2 and 3.

The other projects are examples with EJB.
